How can I show polymorpism? overriding methods


could use composition to get extra details for a car for example... create an engine class and can say it is::

part of a car
part of a motorbike etc..

can do this for other components too -- look in udemy
why and where would i use different constructors?? - look in udemy


Point of making this program?

To sell a car to customer, and to get information about a car

show all principles of OOP - look at the features of each which are best to implement

Encapsulation:
-use private variables
-what else???

Polymorphism:
-Overriding methods
-What else?

Inheritance:
-Extending classes inheriting contructors and methods

Data abstraction:
-hiding methods???
-???


//    could do something like the vehicle has a method called isElectric and that delegates to a engine object
//    So that checks the type of engine object to know if it's electric
